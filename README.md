# Crowdfunding SQL

## Objectives
Learn to create tables, insert data, and use `JOIN`s to answer the questions.

## Create Tables
In the `create.sql` file, model your tables. You should have a table for projects, users, and pledges.

**Create a schema based on the following information:**
- A project has a title, a category, a funding goal, a start date, and an end date.
- A user has a name and an age
- A pledge has an amount. It belongs to a user, and it also belongs to a project.

## Insert Records into Database
Within the `insert.sql` file, insert 10 projects, 20 users, and 30 pledges into the database.

## Queries
Write the following queries in SQL. You'll use different kinds of SQL joins to arrive at the answers for most. Write your queries in the `lib/sql_queries` file like the example below:
```ruby
def select_category_from_projects
  "SELECT category FROM projects;"
end
```

***Note***: `SQL` is a programming language that allows you to "nest" statements inside each other. Let's quickly take a look at an example of ways we can do this.

### Create Our Grocery Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE groceries (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, quantity INTEGER, aisle INTEGER);

INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (1, "Apples", 2, 1);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (2, "Oranges", 4, 2);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES(3, "Peaches", 6, 3);
```

### Grocery Schema
```
id                 name        quantity      aisle       
------------    ----------  ----------  ----------  
1                Apples          2          1
2                Oranges         4          2    
3                Bananas         6          3   
```

### `SUM`
`SUM` will return the total of the column you select. In this case, the total number of items in the `groceries` column is 12.

```sql
SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM groceries;
```

### Returns
```sql
SUM(quantity)
-------------
12
```

#### To make it a little more useful we can `GROUP BY` the aisle that the items are in and `ORDER BY` the sum of the `aisle`.
```sql
SELECT aisle, SUM(quantity) FROM groceries GROUP BY aisle ORDER BY SUM(quantity);
```

### Returns
```sql
aisle	  SUM(quantity)
-------  --------------
1	           2
2	           4
3	           6
```
